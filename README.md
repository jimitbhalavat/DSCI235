### Project Description

COVID-19 is spreading at an alarming rate all around the globe. Healthcare systems are experiencing a tremendous amount of pressure and health professionals are working extra long and exhausting shifts to deal with the demand. COVID-19 is killing people on a large scale. However, the impact of the pandemic and its consequences are felt differently according to the status of an individual. Data by different social identities, such as class, age, gender, and race shows that minorities have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic. These minorities in the United States are not having their right to health fulfilled. The thing that interests me about this topic is that there have been disparities and differences between races and minorities when it comes to covid testing and the number of hospitalizations. 

### Data Description

The data provides total cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and tests conducted for White, Black, Latinx, Native Americans, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (NHPI),  Hispanics, and Non-Hispanics across 55 U.S. States and Territories between April 12, 2020, and March 7, 2021. The COVID Racial Data collects, publishes, and analyzes racial data on the pandemic across the United States. The goal of the data is to gather racial and ethnic demographic data to understand the outbreak and protect vulnerable communities.

The information provided in this data includes the following:
* Cases_(Total, White, Black, Latinx, Asian, Native American, Native Hawaiian, Hispanic, Non-Hispanics): COVID-19 cases for all the races from all 55 U.S. States and Territories over the period of April 12, 2020, and March 7, 2021. 
* Deaths_(Total, White, Black, Latinx, Asian, Native American, Native Hawaiian, Hispanic, Non-Hispanics): COVID-19 related deaths for all the races from all 55 U.S. States and Territories over the period of April 12, 2020, and March 7, 2021. 
* Hosp_(Total, White, Black, Latinx, Asian, Native American, Native Hawaiian, Hispanic, Non-Hispanics): COVID-19 related hospitalizations for all the races from all 55 U.S. States and Territories over the period of April 12, 2020, and March 7, 2021. 
* Tests_(Total, White, Black, Latinx, Asian, Native American, Native Hawaiian, Hispanic, Non-Hispanics): COVID-19 tests conducted for all the races from all 55 U.S. States and Territories over the period of April 12, 2020, and March 7, 2021.
